{\Large Homework 1: Regression}\\
\end{center}

\subsection*{Introduction}
This homework is on different three different forms of regression: kernelized regression, nearest neighbors regression, 
and linear regression.  We will discuss implementation and examine their tradeoffs by implementing them on the same dataset, 
which consists of temperature over the past 800,000 years taken from ice core samples.

The folder \verb|data| contains the data you will use for this problem. There are two files:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|earth_temperature_sampled_train.csv| 
    \item \verb|earth_temperature_sampled_test.csv|
\end{itemize} 

Each has two columns.  The first column is the age of the ice core sample. For our purposes we can 
think of this column as the calendar year BC. The second column is the approximate difference in 
yearly temperature (K) from the mean  over a 5000 year time window starting at the given age. 
The temperatures were retrieved from ice cores in Antarctica (Jouzel 
et al. 2007)\footnote{Retrieved from \url{https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/paleo/icecore/antarctica/epica_domec/edc3deuttemp2007.txt}

If you find that you are having trouble with the first couple
problems, we recommend going over the fundamentals of linear algebra
and matrix calculus (see links on website).  The relevant parts of the
\href{https://github.com/harvard-ml-courses/cs181-textbook/blob/master/Textbook.pdf}{cs181-textbook notes are Sections 2.1 - 2.7}.  We strongly recommend

% Problem 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}[Optimizing a Kernel]
Kernel-based regression techniques are similar to nearest-neighbor
regressors: rather than fit a parametric model, they predict values
for new data points by interpolating values from existing points in
the training set.  In this problem, we will consider a kernel-based
regressor of the form:
\begin{equation*}
  f_\tau(x^*) = \cfrac{\sum_{n} K_\tau(x_n,x^*) y_n}{\sum_n K_\tau(x_n, x^*)} 
\end{equation*}
where $\{(x_n,y_n)\}_{n = 1} ^N$ are the training data points, and $K_\tau(x,x')$ is a
kernel function that defines the similarity between two inputs $x$ and
$x'$. A popular choice of kernel is a function that decays as the
distance between the two points increases, such as
\begin{equation*}
  K_\tau(x,x') = \exp\left\{-\frac{(x-x')^2}{\tau}\right\}
\end{equation*}
where $\tau$ represents the square of the lengthscale (a scalar value that 
dictates how quickly the kernel decays).  In this
problem, we will consider optimizing what that (squared) lengthscale
should be.

\noindent\emph{Make sure to include all required plots in your PDF.}

\begin{enumerate}
  
\item Let's first take a look at the behavior of the fitted model for different values of $\tau$. Plot your model for years in the range $800,000$ BC to $400,000$ BC at $1000$ year intervals for the following three values of $\tau$: $1, 50, 2500$. Since we're working in terms of thousands of years, this means you should plot $(x, f_\tau(x))$ for $x = 400, 401, \dots, 800$. The plotting has been set up for you in the notebook already.


Include your plot in your solution PDF.

\textbf{In no more than 5 sentences}, describe what happens in each of the three cases. How well do the models interpolate? If you were to choose one of these models to use for predicting the temperature at some year in this range, which would you use? 

\item Say we instead wanted to empirically evaluate which value of $\tau$ to choose. One option is to evaluate the mean squared error (MSE) for $f_{\tau}$ on the training set and simply choose the value of $\tau$ that gives the lowest loss. Why is this a bad idea?
    
Hint: consider what value of $\tau$ would be optimal, for $\tau$ ranging in $(0, \infty)$. We can consider $f_\tau(x^*)$ as a weighted average of the training responses, where the weights are proportional to the distance to $x^*$, and the distance is computed via the kernel. What happens to $K_\tau(x, x')$ as $\tau$ becomes very small, when $x = x'$? What about when $x \neq x'$?

\item We will evaluate the models by computing their MSE on the test set. 

Let $\{(x'_m, y'_m)\}_{m = 1} ^M$ denote the test set. Write down the form of the MSE of $f_\tau$ over the test set as a function of the training set and test set. Your answer may include $\{(x'_m, y'_m)\}_{m = 1} ^M$, $\{(x_n, y_n)\}_{n = 1} ^N$, and $K_\tau$, but not $f_\tau$.

\item We now compute the MSE on the provided training set. Write Python code to compute the MSE with respect to the same lengthscales as in Part 1. Which model yields the lowest test set MSE? Is this consistent with what you observed in Part 1?

\item 
Say you would like to send your friend your kernelized regressor, so that they can reproduce the same exact predictions as you. You of course will tell them the value of $\tau$ you selected, but what other information would they need, assuming they don't currently have any of your data or code? If our training set has size $N$, how does this amount of information grow as a function of $N$—that is, what is the space complexity of storing our model?

What is the time complexity of your implementation, when computing your model on a new datapoint? 
\end{enumerate}

\end{problem}

\begin{solution}[Optimizing a Kernel]

\noindent
% \begin{equation*}
%   f_\tau(x^*) = \cfrac{\sum_{n} K_\tau(x_n,x^*) y_n}{\sum_n K_\tau(x_n, x^*)}, K_\tau(x,x') = \exp\left\{-\frac{(x-x')^2}{\tau}\right\}
% \end{equation*}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{Problem1.png}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
  The first and third graphs are overfit and underfit respectively.
  $\tau = 1$ is too biased (technically, bias is too low) toward the training data, so test predictions may be
  unnecessarily inaccurate due to the model overfitting to a unique quality of
  the training data that differs from future test data/the true data.
  Meanwhile, $\tau = 2500$ has been significantly underfit such that 
  the "spiky" pattern in the training data is hardly represented by the model.
  In this case, the variance is over optimized to the point where excessive bias
  plagues the model.
  Based on intuition, it seems that the second graph is a better middle ground in terms of
  balancing bias and variance, so I would probably use tau=50 for predictions. 

  \item The MSE is minimized when tau is minimized, but this leads to overfitting. As tau approaches 0,
  the kernel function approaches $e^{-\infty}$ (approaches zero), meaning that we can effectively force the MSE to zero
  by minimizing tau, which severely overfits the MSE.
  \item
  \begin{align*}
    MSE &= \frac{1}{M}\Sigma_{m=1}^{M}(f_{\tau}(x_{m}')-y_{m}')^2\\
    &= \frac{1}{M}\Sigma_{m=1}^{M}(\frac{\Sigma_{n}K_{\tau}(x_n,x_{m}')y_n}{\Sigma_{n}K_{\tau}(x_n,x_{m}')}-y_{m}')^2
  \end{align*}
  \item (see code)\\
  $\tau=50$ yields the lowest test set MSE (1.858), which is consistent with
  my observations in Part 1 (it has a slight edge over $\tau=1$ because it's less
  overfit)
  \item I would have to send the dataset because the function iterates
  over every data point, so the space complexity is $O(n)$. Calculating
  a single point has time complexity $O(n)$ because you have to iterate through
  each point to calculate the sum (bottom term) and also multiply $y_n$ to each
  in the process (top term), but you can do both of these calculations together, so O(n).
\end{enumerate}

\end{solution}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Problem 2
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\newpage
\begin{problem}[Kernels and kNN]

Now, let us compare the kernel-based approach to an approach based on
nearest-neighbors.  Recall that kNN uses a predictor of the form
  \begin{equation*}
    f(x^*) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_n y_n \mathbb{I}(x_n \texttt{ is one of k-closest to } x^*)
  \end{equation*}

\noindent where $\mathbb{I}$ is an indicator variable. For this problem, you will use the \textbf{same dataset as in Problem 1}.


%\textbf{For this problem, you may also use the second half of the notebook at {\color{red} update name} \texttt{T1\_P1-2.ipynb}.} 

\textbf{Note that our set of test cases is not comprehensive: just because you pass does not mean your solution is correct! We strongly encourage you to write your own test cases and read more about ours in the comments of the Python script.}

\vspace{0.5cm}
\noindent\emph{Make sure to include all required plots in your PDF.}


\begin{enumerate}

\item Implement kNN for $k=\{1, 3, N-1\}$ where $N$ is the size of the dataset, then plot the results for each $k$. To find the distance between points, use the kernel function from Problem 1 with lengthscale $\tau=2500$. 

You will plot $x^*$ on the year-axis and the prediction $f(x^*)$ on the temperature-axis.  For the test inputs $x^*$, you should use an even grid spacing of $1$ between $x^* = 800$ and $x^* = 400$.  (Like in Problem 1, if a test point lies on top of a training input, use the formula without excluding that training input.) Again, this has been set up for you already.

Please \textbf{write your own
    implementation of kNN} for full credit.  Do not use external
  libraries to find nearest neighbors.
  
\item Describe what you see: what is the behavior of the functions in
  these three plots?  How does it compare to the behavior of the
  functions in the three plots from Problem 1? In particular, which of the plots from Problem 1 look most similar to each in Problem 2? Are there situations
  in which kNN and kernel-based regression interpolate similarly?

\item Choose the kNN model you most prefer among the three. Which model did you choose and why? What is its mean squared error on the test set?

\item As before, say you wanted to send your friend your kNN, so that they can reproduce the same exact predictions as you. You will again tell them the value of the $k$ you selected, but what other information would they need, assuming they do not currently have any of your data or code, and how does this information grow as a function of the size of the training set, $N$? Again worded more formally, what is the space complexity of storing your model?

What is the time complexity of your implementation, when computing your model on a new datapoint? Give a brief overview of your implementation when you justify your answers. 
\end{enumerate}

\end{problem}

\newpage
\begin{solution}[Kernels and kNN]

\noindent
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{Problem2.png}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item (see code)
  \item $k=1$ and $k=3$ both appear reasonable, while $k=N-1$ fails
  to capture the trends of the data. The kernelized regression graphs
  look smoother than the knn graphs, but overall ($\tau=1, k=1$) and ($\tau=50, k=3$)
  are very similar. Meanwhile, $k=N-1$ looks very different from $\tau=2500$,
  though they both "flatten" the graph too much.
  \item Similar to problem 1, the middle graph appears to be the best
  because it offers a balance between the two other graphs (though k=N-1 can
  hardly be considered relevant). The bias-variance tradeoff is preferable in
  $k=3$ because $k=1$ is a very low parameter that likely overfits the training data.
  The MSE for $k=3$ is 3.89, which is worse than the MSE for $k=1$ (1.74).
  However, the MSE is not the only metric available for evaluating a model.
  $k=3$ sacrifices some MSE-accuracy for better generalizability.
  \item Once again, we are iterating through all of the points in
  the data set to calculate the nearest neighbors. Therefore, we need
  to store all of the data points, which has space complexity $O(n)$. However, in our implementation,
  we had to sort the data points in order to calculate the nearest neighbors.
  The sorting algorithm used has a time complexity of $O(n\log(n))$, and this is
  the slowest part of the model, so the overall time complexity is $O(n\log(n))$ for
  a single point.

\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Problem 3
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\newpage
\begin{problem}[Modeling Climate Change 800,000 Years Ago]

 The objective of this problem is to learn about different forms of
 linear regression with basis functions.

\vspace{1em}
\noindent\emph{Make sure to include all required plots in your PDF.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Recall that in \emph{Ordinary Least Squares} (OLS) regression,
we have data $\{(\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^N = \{\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{y}\}$ 
where $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times D}$. The goal is to find 
the weights $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^{D}$ for a model 
$\hat{\mathbf{y}} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{w}$ such that the MSE 
\[ \frac{1}{N} \| \mathbf{y} - \hat{\mathbf{y}}\|^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1} ^N (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2\] 
is minimized. 

Without any novel bases, we have merely a single feature $D=1$, 
the year, which is not enough to model our data. Hence, in this 
problem you will improve the expressivity of our regression 
model by implementing different bases functions 
$\mathbf{\phi} = (\phi_1,\ldots,\phi_D)$. In order to avoid numerical instability, 
we must transform the data first. Let
this transformation be $f$, which has been introduced in
the code for you in the notebook.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\phi_j(x)= f(x)^j$ for $j=1,\ldots, 9$. $f(x) = \frac{x}{1.81 \cdot 10^{2}}.$
  \item $\phi_j(x) = \exp\left\{-\cfrac{(f(x)-\mu_j)^2}{5}\right\}$ for $\mu_j=\frac{j + 7}{8}$ with $j=1,\ldots, 9$. $f(x) = \frac{x}{4.00 \cdot 10^{2}}.$
  \item $\phi_j(x) =  \cos(f(x) / j)$ for $j=1, \ldots, 9$. $f(x) = \frac{x}{1.81}$.
  \item $\phi_j(x) = \cos(f(x) / j)$ for $j=1, \ldots, 49$. $f(x) = \frac{x}{1.81 \cdot 10^{-1}}$. \footnote{For the trigonometric bases (c) and (d), the periodic nature of
cosine requires us to transform the data such that the 
lengthscale is within the periods of each element of our basis.}

\end{enumerate}

{\footnotesize * Note: Please make sure to add a bias term for
all your basis functions above in your implementation of the 
\verb|make_basis|.}

Let 
$$ \mathbf{\phi}(\mathbf{X}) = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
\mathbf{\phi}(x_1) \\
\mathbf{\phi}(x_2) \\
\vdots \\
\mathbf{\phi}(x_N) \\
\end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times D}.$$
You will complete the \verb|make_basis| function which must return
$\phi(\mathbf{X})$ for each part 
(a) - (d). You do NOT need to submit this
code in your \LaTeX writeup.


For each basis create a plot of your code graphing the OLS 
regression line trained on your training data against a 
scatter plot of the training data. Boilerplate plotting code
is provided in the notebook. \textbf{All you need to include 
in your writeup for 4.1 are these four plots.}
\vspace{1em}
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}


\newpage
\begin{framed}
\noindent\textbf{Problem 3} (cont.)\\
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item 

We now have four different models to evaluate. Our models had no
prior knowledge of any of the testing data, thus evaluating on
the test set allows us to make stronger (but not definitive!) 
claims on the generalizability of our model.

Observe that there is never an objectively ``good'' value of MSE or negative log likelihood - we can use them to compare models, but without context, they don't tell us whether or not our model performs well.

For each basis function, complete three tasks and include the
results in your writeup: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Compute the MSE on the train and test set. 

\item Assume that the data is distributed as 
$y_i = \mathbf{w}^\top \mathbf{x}_i + \varepsilon$ where 
$\varepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$, we roll in the bias 
$\mathbf{x}_i = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ x_i \end{bmatrix}$, and each data point
is drawn independently. Find $\sigma_{\text{MLE}}$ and $\mathbf{w}_{\text{MLE}}$ (recall the formulas from class!) and use these to 
compute the negative log-likelihood of a model with parameters $\sigma_{\text{MLE}}, \mathbf{w}_{\text{MLE}}$ on your train and test sets. 
The following derives the likelihood.
\begin{align*} p(\mathbf{y}\mid \mathbf{X},\mathbf{w},\sigma_{\text{MLE}}) 
&= \prod_{i=1}^N \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{y}_i \mid \mathbf{w}^\top\mathbf{x_i}, \sigma_{\text{MLE}}^2) \\
&= \prod_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{\sigma_{\text{MLE}}\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left(-\frac{(y_i - \mathbf{w}^\top \mathbf{x}_i)^2}{2\sigma_{\text{MLE}}^2}\right)
\end{align*}

\item Make a claim regarding whether this basis overfits, 
underfits, or fits well. Write 1-2 sentences explaining your 
claim using the train and test negative log-likelihood and MSE.

\end{itemize}
\item For the third time, you wish to send your friend your model. Lets say you fitted some weight vector of dimension $D$. What information would you need to share with your friend for them to perform the same predictions as you? Do you need to share your entire training set with them this time? Again, what is the space complexity of storing your model?

Given an arbitrary datapoint, what is the time complexity of computing the predicted value for this data point?

How do these complexities compare to those of the kNN and kernelized regressor?

\textbf{Your response should be no longer than 5 sentences.}

\end{enumerate}
Note:
Recall that we are using a 
different set of inputs $\mathbf{X}$ for each basis (a)-(d). 
Although it may seem as though this prevents us from being able 
to directly compare the MSE since we are using different data, 
each transformation can be considered as being a part of our model. 
Contrast this with transformations (such as standardization) that cause the variance
of the target $\mathbf{y}$ to be different; in these cases the
MSE can no longer be directly compared.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item (see graph above)
  \item (see notes), $w^{MLE} = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty$
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Train MSE: 4.83; Test MSE: 7.96\\
      Train NLL: 762.399; Test NLL: 523.304\\
      This basis hardly captures the trend in the data and has
      poor metrics. We can probably do better.
      \item Train MSE: 4.22; Test MSE: 7.76\\
      Train NLL: 601.027; Test NLL: 450.117\\
      Though this basis has better metrics, its only slightly better.
      The model could probably be improved (more complexity) to achieve
      better accuracy at the cost of good variance.
      \item Train MSE: 2.88; Test MSE: 5.97\\
      Train NLL: 318.767; Test NLL: 250.941\\
      This basis looks good! The train and test metrics
      are pretty similar, so we know that, the model is not overfitting the
      training data. Additionally, the MSE values are decent, so 
      the mode is probably complex enough to fit well.
      Visually, graph appears to fit the trend of the data fairly well.
      \item Train MSE: 0.64; Test MSE: 58.91\\
      Train NLL: 51.594; Test NLL: 491.076\\
      This basis severely overfits. The Train metrics are extremely small, 
      but the Test metrics are ridiculously high. Looking at the graph, we can see that 
      the model has crazy waves but they line up on the training data very well.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item I would just need to share the weight vector with dimension D,
    so the space complexity is just $O(D)$. The time complexity is
    also $O(k)$ because we are just multiplying once for each weight vector.
    These complexities are significantly better than kNN or kernelized regression.
    (unless the number of features is greater than $O(n)$ or $O(n\log(n))$

\begin{problem}[Impact question: Building a descriptive (explanatory) linear regression model to understand the drivers of US energy consumption, to inform national policy decisions by the US President.]


\textbf{Prompt:} You are leading the machine learning team that is advising the US president. The US president is concerned about 3 things - climate change, the energy crisis in Europe and sustainable energy security in the US and asks you to help him understand what the driving factors of annual US energy consumption might be.  


How would you build a regression model that can be used to explain the driving factors of the annual US energy consumption? Please answer the questions below by using concise language (350 - 700 words). Bullet points are appropriate. 


This question is a conceptual question, and you are not required to implement the actual model. Yet, it is important that you think through your approach and its implications. 


\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Target variable:} What target variable would you choose and what would be its unit? 
\item \textbf{Features:}  List 5 possible features and explain your assumption why you think they might impact the target variable. 
\item \textbf{Dataset size:} What should be the size of your dataset / covered time period? Why? 
\item \textbf{Performance metric:} What metric would you use to assess the model’s performance? 
\item \textbf{Policy decision:} Explain one policy decision the US president could make based on your model. 
\item \textbf{Trust:} What could be barriers for the US president to trust your model?  List two possible barriers. 
\item \textbf{Risk:} What happens if your model is wrong/inaccurate?  List one real-world consequence.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Solution 4

\newpage
\begin{solution}[Impact]

  \noindent 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item My target variable would be total US energy consumption per capita per year
    (measured in gigajoules, so gj/capita measured across years)
    \item There are a lot of options for choosing features, depending on
    what data is available. I would analyze how each sector in the
    US economy contributes to energy consumption (Industrial, Commercial, Residential, Transportation sectors).
    Therefore, I would look at driving factors behind these sectors, such as
    overall growth/cash flow of each sector (perhaps the Transportation sector dipped during
    2020-2021 and thus had reduced contribution to energy consumption), the profits of
    each sector (a sector might be smaller but earn more profit, thus growing at a higher rate – 
    new rising companies that consume a significant amount of energy would be relevant),
    or the subsidies/taxes/regulations on sectors/companies in each sector (this may be hard to measure, but 
    if data is available to numerically represent overall "regulation" on a sector, then we could determine 
    how government regulation can influence a sector's energy consumption). This would make 12 features (3 for each sector).
    \item The dataset would focus on recent decades because going further back
    only brings data that is not representative of current circumstances.
    \item I would use linear regression to predict energy usage (a coefficient for each feature) and assess
    its performance on a loss function that minimizes the MSE. The coefficients would
    reveal what impact each feature has on the total US energy consumption (thanks
    to the high interpretability of this linear regression)
    \item If the model shows that applying taxes/regulation specifically upon the Industrial
    sector has a significant impact on US energy consumption (relative to other features), 
    then the US president could consider increasing regulation on
    this sector. 
    \item The US president might be a skeptic of machine learning or might not
    trust it because he doesn't understand it. If he does have a good understanding,
    he might not trust the model if it has very high uncertainty and bad metrics.
    \item If the model is wrong, the US president might make a poorly-informed 
    policy decision. For example, he might greatly restrict a sector by imposing 
    new regulation when it turns out that this regulation hardly improves 
    US energy consumption.
